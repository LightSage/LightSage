Breed: California Spangled

Description: Perhaps the only thing about the California spangled cat that isn‚Äôt wild-like is its personality. Known to be affectionate, gentle and sociable, this breed enjoys spending a great deal of time with its owners. They are very playful, often choosing to perch in high locations and show off their acrobatic skills.
