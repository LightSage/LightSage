Breed: Aegean

Description: Native to the Greek islands known as the Cyclades in the Aegean Sea, these are natural cats, meaning they developed without humans getting involved in their breeding. As a breed, Aegean Cats are rare, although they are numerous on their home islands. They are generally friendly toward people and can be excellent cats for families with children.
