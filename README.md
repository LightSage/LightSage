Breed: Oriental

Description: Orientals are passionate about the people in their lives. They become extremely attached to their humans, so be prepared for a lifetime commitment. When you are not available to entertain her, an Oriental will divert herself by jumping on top of the refrigerator, opening drawers, seeking out new hideaways.
