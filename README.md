Breed: Birman

Description: The Birman is a docile, quiet cat who loves people and will follow them from room to room. Expect the Birman to want to be involved in what you‚Äôre doing. He communicates in a soft voice, mainly to remind you that perhaps it‚Äôs time for dinner or maybe for a nice cuddle on the sofa. He enjoys being held and will relax in your arms like a furry baby.
