Breed: Donskoy

Description: Donskoy are affectionate, intelligent, and easy-going. They demand lots of attention and interaction. The Donskoy also gets along well with other pets. It is now thought the same gene that causes degrees of hairlessness in the Donskoy also causes alterations in cat personality, making them calmer the less hair they have.
