Breed: Australian Mist

Description: The Australian Mist thrives on human companionship. Tolerant of even the youngest of children, these friendly felines enjoy playing games and being part of the hustle and bustle of a busy household. They make entertaining companions for people of all ages, and are happy to remain indoors between dusk and dawn or to be wholly indoor pets.
