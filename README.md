Breed: Turkish Van

Description: While the Turkish Van loves to jump and climb, play with toys, retrieve and play chase, she is is big and ungainly; this is one cat who doesn‚Äôt always land on his feet. While not much of a lap cat, the Van will be happy to cuddle next to you and sleep in your bed.
