Breed: Chantilly-Tiffany

Description: The Chantilly is a devoted companion and prefers company to being left alone. While the Chantilly is not demanding, she will "chirp" and "talk" as if having a conversation. This breed is affectionate, with a sweet temperament. It can stay still for extended periods, happily lounging in the lap of its loved one. This quality makes the Tiffany an ideal traveling companion, and an ideal house companion for senior citizens and the physically handicapped.
