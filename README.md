Breed: Exotic Shorthair

Description: The Exotic Shorthair is a gentle friendly cat that has the same personality as the Persian. They love having fun, don’t mind the company of other cats and dogs, also love to curl up for a sleep in a safe place. Exotics love their own people, but around strangers they are cautious at first. Given time, they usually warm up to visitors.
