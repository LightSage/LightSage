Breed: Colorpoint Shorthair

Description: Colorpoint Shorthairs are an affectionate breed, devoted and loyal to their people. Sensitive to their owner‚Äôs moods, Colorpoints are more than happy to sit at your side or on your lap and purr words of encouragement on a bad day. They will constantly seek out your lap whenever it is open and in the moments when your lap is preoccupied they will stretch out in sunny spots on the ground.
