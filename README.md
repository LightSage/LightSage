Breed: Burmese

Description: Burmese love being with people, playing with them, and keeping them entertained. They crave close physical contact and abhor an empty lap. They will follow their humans from room to room, and sleep in bed with them, preferably under the covers, cuddled as close as possible. At play, they will turn around to see if their human is watching and being entertained by their crazy antics.
