Breed: Japanese Bobtail

Description: The Japanese Bobtail is an active, sweet, loving and highly intelligent breed. They love to be with people and play seemingly endlessly. They learn their name and respond to it. They bring toys to people and play fetch with a favorite toy for hours. Bobtails are social and are at their best when in the company of people. They take over the house and are not intimidated. If a dog is in the house, Bobtails assume Bobtails are in charge.
