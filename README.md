Breed: Chausie

Description: For those owners who desire a feline capable of evoking the great outdoors, the strikingly beautiful Chausie retains a bit of the wild in its appearance but has the house manners of our friendly, familiar moggies. Very playful, this cat needs a large amount of space to be able to fully embrace its hunting instincts.
