Breed: Cornish Rex

Description: This is a confident cat who loves people and will follow them around, waiting for any opportunity to sit in a lap or give a kiss. He enjoys being handled, making it easy to take him to the veterinarian or train him for therapy work. The Cornish Rex stay in kitten mode most of their lives and well into their senior years.
