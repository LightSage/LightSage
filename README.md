Breed: Egyptian Mau

Description: The Egyptian Mau is gentle and reserved. She loves her people and desires attention and affection from them but is wary of others. Early, continuing socialization is essential with this sensitive and sometimes shy cat, especially if you plan to show or travel with her. Otherwise, she can be easily startled by unexpected noises or events.
