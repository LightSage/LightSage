Breed: Norwegian Forest Cat

Description: The Norwegian Forest Cat is a sweet, loving cat. She appreciates praise and loves to interact with her parent. She makes a loving companion and bonds with her parents once she accepts them for her own. She is still a hunter at heart. She loves to chase toys as if they are real. She is territorial and patrols several times each day to make certain that all is fine.
