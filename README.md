Breed: Malayan

Description: Malayans love to explore and even enjoy traveling by way of a cat carrier. They are quite a talkative and rather loud cat with an apparent strong will. These cats will make sure that you give it the attention it seeks and always seem to want to be held and hugged. They will constantly interact with people, even strangers. They love to play and cuddle.
