Breed: Havana Brown

Description: The Havana Brown is human oriented, playful, and curious. She has a strong desire to spend time with her people and involve herself in everything they do. Being naturally inquisitive, the Havana Brown reaches out with a paw to touch and feel when investigating curiosities in its environment. They are truly sensitive by nature and frequently gently touch their human companions as if they are extending a paw of friendship.
